# Grid

The grid creates visual consistency between layouts while allowing flexibility across a wide variety of designs. Material Design's responsive UI is based on a 12-column grid layout.

## How it works
The grid system is implemented with the Grid component:

- It uses CSS's Flexible Box module for high flexibility.
- There are two types of layout: containers and items.
- Item widths are set in percentages, so they're always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.
- Items have padding to create the spacing between individual items.
- There are five grid breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, and xl.
- Integer values can be given to each breakpoint, indicating how many of the 12 available columns are occupied by the component when the viewport width satisfies the breakpoint constraints.

If you are new to or unfamiliar with flexbox, we encourage you to read this CSS-Tricks flexbox guide.

## Fluid grids
Fluid grids use columns that scale and resize content. A fluid grid's layout can use breakpoints to determine if the layout needs to change dramatically.

## Basic grid
Column widths are integer values between 1 and 12; they apply at any breakpoint and indicate how many columns are occupied by the component.

A value passed to any given breakpoint also applies to all wider breakpoints (if they have no values explicitly defined). For example, `xs={12}` sizes a component to occupy the full width of its parent container, regardless of the viewport size.

## Grid with multiple breakpoints
Components may have multiple widths defined, causing the layout to change at the defined breakpoint. Width values given to larger breakpoints override those given to smaller breakpoints.

For example, `xs={12} sm={6}` sizes a component to occupy half of the viewport width (6 columns) when viewport width is **600 or more pixels.** For smaller viewports, the component fills all 12 available columns.
